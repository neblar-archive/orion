# Reactified Shopify

This boiler plate is used to deploy a React App to Shopify.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Download the repository
3. Run `npm i` in the repository's root folder to setup
4. Run `npm start` to preview a live hot-reloading version of the app

## Deploying

1. Build the app first by running `npm run build`.
2. Make sure you have themekit (Shopify's theme manager) installed on your machine.
3. Make a themekit configuration file having *store*, *theme_id* & *password* for *production* build; usually stored as a .yml file.
